blueprinted
===========================
vector tile styles inspired by cyanotype reproductions of technical drawings

_Note: This style was built in Mapbox Studio Classic and is not compatible with the new, web-GL-based in-browser Mapbox Studio._

This was my first attempt at a custom basemap style, begun in Summer 2014, using a pre-release version of [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/).
_This is a work-in-progress._

##To use
 - Fork & Clone repository to local machine

##To Contribute
 - Create a feature branch(es) in your local repository (e.g. 'water-textures')
