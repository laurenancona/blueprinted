This was my first attempt at a custom basemap style, begun in Summer 2014, using a pre-release version of Mapbox Studio.
_This is a work-in-progress, to be completed Spring 2015._

##To use
 - Fork & Clone repository to local machine
 - Open Mapbox Studio
 - Under 'Project' menu, select 'Browse'
 - Navigate to the repository folder and select 'Open'

##To Contribute:
 - Create a feature branch(es) in your local repository (e.g. 'water-textures')
 - Make and save your changes in Mapbox Studio, then quit _(MB Studio does not refresh changes to project files while running, so best to exit)_
 - Commit changes from local repository to remote feature branch
 - Submit a pull request
